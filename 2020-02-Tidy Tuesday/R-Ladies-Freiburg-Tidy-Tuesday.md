I upload all my TidyTuesdays with the code to my Github repo, here are a couple of my favorites, all done together with R-Ladies Freiburg:

##### 20.01. Trees in San Fransisco 
A bar graph showing public and private ownership of trees in the city of San Fransisco, and a possible correlation to the time point when the city trasnfered trees to private liability.

##### 04.02. Football attendance in the US
My first try at Rayshader for 3D graphs, as well as my first time working with spatial data! This graph shows the football attendance by state in the US (though be aware that some states with better attendance may also just have more teams..!)

##### 20.02 The effect of beef consumption on global warming
A basic dashboard showing the effect of global food consumption on CO-emissions, focussing on cows (beef and milk/cheese).

## Future goals 

Here we could add:

- Some data visualization we find nice and we would want to reproduce (could be a link or an image)

- Packages to visualize data that we would want to learn how to use

> I would love if we can have a short session on working with time series data using latest tsibble/fable package in future[name=Vaibhav]

> I would love to do learn some Shiny & R Markdown!
> 

> I'd like to learn to make interactive dashboards with Shiny! [name=Kyla]
>> Same here, please! [name=Julia]

- New analysis, statistics techniques we would want to learn

> I would really want to learn some text analysis using R. It seems like the data set from May 5th is perfect for that. I also found a book that might help. Here is the link of [Tidy Text Mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com) free book. [name=Elisa]
