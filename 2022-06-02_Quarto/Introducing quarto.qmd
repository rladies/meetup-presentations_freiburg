# What is Quarto?
- publishing system
- lets you combine text, code, and code output
- output formats: articles, presentations, websites, books, blogs...

Sound familiar?
- it's very similar to R Markdown
-> if you know R Markdown, you'll find it easy to switch

We recently did a workshop on R Markdown:
https://youtu.be/l12RpPbZJUA

- but: Quarto is designed to more seamlessly handle different output formats
- and: Quarto can be used for other programming languages such as Python and Julia
- ...as well as within other code editors like VS Code
- it also seems to have some additional features

## Installation
If you want to follow along with my demonstrations/try Quarto for yourself later:
- download Quarto at: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
- ...and install

# Getting started with Quarto in RStudio
- once Quarto is installed, it'll be an option when you create a new document
- enter title (and author)
- lots of output options to choose from
- can set theme and options like table of contents straight away (but this can also be changed/added later)

## The same as in R Markdown
- a lot of the YAML (sometimes, R Markdown uses an underscore where Quarto uses a hyphen)
- text formatting options, e.g., headlines, bold and italics, lists
- references (but Quarto automatically adds a headline that reads "References")
- inserting pictures (but see layout options below)

## Different to R Markdown

### Labelling figures
In the code block in which a graph is created or called, you can add options such as labels (#| label: ) and captions (#| fig-cap: )
Both will be displayed underneath the graph.

Pictures can also get a label: {#fig-label}

The labels can be used for in-text references with @fig-label

### On slides: Code isn't shown by default
Use:
```{r}
#| echo: true
```
...in individual code blocks

Or:
echo: true
in the YAML


## New additions

### Arranging pictures
Pictures can still be inserted using:
![Caption](file.png)

Several pictures can be arranged more easily using layout-ncol or layout-nrow - for example:
::: {layout-ncol=2}
![Caption](file1.png)
![Caption](file2.png)
:::

Custom layouts are also possible - more info:
https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html


### Callout blocks

The five callout blocks:
- note
- tip
- warning
- caution
- important

Callout blocks are framed by :::{callout-TypeOfCallout} and :::

More info: https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/callouts.html


### Placing content in the margins

To put footnotes and references in the margins of the document instead of at the bottom, we can add the following lines to the YAML:
reference-location: margin
citation-location: margin

You can also add asides in the margins:
[This is an aside, text that will be displayed in the margin.]{.aside}

Figure captions can also be placed in the margin:
```{r}
#| cap-location: margin
```


# Other output formats

Like R Markdown documents, Quarto documents can be rendered to Word and PDF

For output formats such as Word and PDFs, page breaks can be added using:
{{< pagebreak >}}
