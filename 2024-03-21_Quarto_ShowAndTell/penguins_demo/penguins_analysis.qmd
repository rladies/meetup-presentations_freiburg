# Introduction

## The data set

As everyone always says, penguins are very cute, so let's work with penguin data today.  

![Penguin species drawing by Allison Horst](img/penguin_species.png){#fig-penguins width=10cm fig-align="left"}

Note that the palmerpenguins dataset is meant as an alternative to the commonly used iris data and contains data on three species - see @fig-penguins.

More information on this data set is available on [Allison Horst's Github page.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)  

<br>

## Data source

Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

This data can also be used via the {palmerpenguins} package [@Horst.2020] and was originally introduced in @Gorman.2014.

<br>

<br>

# Descriptive statistics

We've removed missing values here, which means that the data has `r nrow(penguins)` rows[^1].

<br>

## Overall statistics

![Explaining bill dimensions](img/culmen_depth.png){#fig-bill height=5cm fig-align="left"}

Some descriptive statistics:

The data was collected between `r min(penguins$year)` and `r max(penguins$year)`.

* bill lengths and depths
  + the average bill length is `r round(mean(penguins$bill_length_mm), digits = 2)` mm 
  + the average bill depth is `r round(mean(penguins$bill_depth_mm), digits = 2)` mm
* body mass
  + the average weight is `r round(mean(penguins$body_mass_g), digits = 2)` g

```{r}
penguins_bill_island <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(island) %>% 
  summarise(m = mean(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, digits = 2)))
```

<br>

Penguins on the island `r penguins_bill_island %>% slice_min(order_by = m, n = 1) %>% select(island)` have the smallest average bill length: `r penguins_bill_island %>% slice_min(order_by = m, n = 1) %>% select(m)` mm (cf. @tbl-billIslands).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-billIslands
#| tbl-cap: Bill lengths (in mm) by island
penguins_bill_island %>% 
  rename("average bill length" = m) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(format = "markdown")
```

<br>


<br>

## Separate per species

```{r}
penguins_bill_species <- penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise("avg" = mean(bill_length_mm),
            "var" = var(bill_length_mm),
            "sd" = sd(bill_length_mm)) %>% 
    mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, digits = 2)))
```

@tbl-billSpecies shows bill lengths for each of the three species in the data. We can see that the average bill length for Chinstrap penguins is `r penguins_bill_species %>% filter(species == "Chinstrap") %>% select(avg) - penguins_bill_species %>% filter(species == "Adelie") %>% select(avg)` mm longer than that for Adelie penguins.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-billSpecies
#| tbl-cap: Bill lengths (in mm) by species
penguins_bill_species %>% 
  rename("average bill length" = avg,
            "variance" = var,
            "std. deviation" = sd) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(format = "markdown")
```

# Graphs

**Hypotheses:**

1. Flipper length and body mass are *positively* associated.
1. This is true for ***all*** three species in the data.

<br>

The following graphs are slightly simplified versions from the [vignette for the {palmerpenguins} package.](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/examples.html)

<br>

## Weight and flipper length: Entire data
```{r}
#| label: fig-entire
#| fig-cap: Penguin flipper length and body mass
mass_flipper <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", colour = my_colours[2]) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)")

mass_flipper
```

Refer to @fig-bill for an explanation of the measurements.

<br>

## Weight and flipper length: Separated by species
```{r}
mass_flipper_species <- ggplot(data = penguins,
                       aes(x = flipper_length_mm,
                           y = body_mass_g)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species,
                 shape = species),
             size = 3,
             alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_smooth(aes(colour = species),
              method = "lm") +
  scale_color_manual(values = my_colours) +
  labs(title = "Penguin size, Palmer Station LTER",
       subtitle = "Flipper length and body mass for Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo Penguins",
       x = "Flipper length (mm)",
       y = "Body mass (g)",
       color = "Penguin species",
       shape = "Penguin species")
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-species
#| fig-cap: Penguin flipper length and body mass, separately by species
mass_flipper_species
```

@fig-entire does not separate the data by species, while @fig-species does.

# Regression modeling

## Model output
We've constructed a mixed-effects model that predicts bill length by bill depth, body mass, and their interaction, with island as a random intercept.

```{r}
#| eval: false
# code chunk will not be executed

# running the model once in RStudio
penguins_mdl <- lmer(bill_length_mm ~ bill_depth_mm * body_mass_g +
                       (1|island), 
                   data = penguins)

# ...and saving it to the models subfolder
save(penguins_mdl, file = "models/penguins_mdl.rds")
```

```{r}
# This chunk will be run during rendering
# Loading the model object:
load("models/penguins_mdl.rds")

penguins_mdl_tidy <- tidy(penguins_mdl) %>% 
  filter(effect == "fixed") %>% 
  select(-c(effect, group, df)) %>% 
  mutate(across(where(is.numeric), \(x) round(x, digits = 4)), # round numeric variables to 4 decimals
         p.value = as.character(p.value), # this rounding can cause p-values to show up as 0.0000
         p.value = if_else(p.value == 0.0000, "< 0.0001", p.value) # ...so we're replacing those with "< 0.0001"
         ) %>% 
  rename( # renaming the columns
    "standard error" = std.error,
    "t-value" = statistic, # in Poisson and logistic regressions, z-value - otherwise t-value
    "p-value" = p.value
  )
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-penguinsMdl
#| tbl-cap: Model output - Predicting penguin bill lengths
penguins_mdl_tidy %>% 
  mutate(term = fct_recode(term, # rename the factor levels (= the intercept and slopes)
                          "Intercept" = "(Intercept)",
                          "Bill depth (in mm)" = "bill_depth_mm",
                          "Body mass (in g)" = "body_mass_g",
                          "Bill depth : Body mass" = "bill_depth_mm:body_mass_g"
                          )) %>% 
  kableExtra::kbl(format = "markdown")
```

The model output is shown in @tbl-penguinsMdl. Only the slope for body mass is significant at p < 0.05 (&beta; = `r penguins_mdl_tidy %>% filter(term == "body_mass_g") %>% select(estimate)`, SE = `r penguins_mdl_tidy %>% filter(term == "body_mass_g") %>% select('standard error')`).

<br>

## Model predictions

The model predictions are visualised in @fig-MdlPred. They show that as body mass increases, so does the predicted bill length.

```{r}
#| label: fig-MdlPred
#| fig-cap: Model predictions for bill lengths for different body masses
plot(ggeffect(penguins_mdl, term = "body_mass_g")) +
  labs(title = "Model predictions",
       x = "Body mass (in g)",
       y = "Predicted bill length (in mm)")
```

[^1]: Note that this removes any rows with missing values!
